# Android-Malware-Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017)

We propose our new Android malware dataset here, named CICAndMal2017. In this approach, we run our both malware and benign applications on real smartphones to avoid runtime behavior modification of advanced malware samples that are able to detect the emulator environment. We collected more than 10,854 samples (4,354 malware and 6,500 benign) from several sources. We have collected over six thousand benign apps from Googleplay market published in 2015, 2016, 2017.

We installed 5,000 of the collected samples (426 malware and 5,065 benign) on real devices. Our malware samples in the CICAndMal2017 dataset are classified into four categories:

    Adware
    Ransomware
    Scareware
    SMS Malware

Our samples come from 42 unique malware families. The family kinds of each category and the numbers of the captured samples are as follows:
Adware

    Dowgin family, 10 captured samples
    Ewind family, 10 captured samples
    Feiwo family, 15 captured samples
    Gooligan family, 14 captured samples
    Kemoge family, 11 captured samples
    koodous family, 10 captured samples
    Mobidash family, 10 captured samples

### Experiments and Content
In order to acquire a comprehensive view of our malware samples, we created a specific scenario for each malware category. We also defined three states of data capturing in order to overcome the stealthiness of an advanced malware:

    Installation: The first state of data capturing which occurs immediately after installing malware (1-3 min).
    Before restart: The second state of data capturing which occurs 15 min before rebooting phones.
    After restart: The last state of data capturing which occurs 15 min after rebooting phones.

For feature Extraction and Selection, we captured network traffic features (.pcap files), and extracted more than 80 features by using [**CICFlowMeter-V3**][https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter] during all three mentioned states (installation, before restart, and after restart).
